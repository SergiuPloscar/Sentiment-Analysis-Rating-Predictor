1,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50...",TERRIBLE DONT BUY
1,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.,Ended up returning
1,Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.,returned item
1,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",Too may preloaded useless apps
1,I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.,Broke in 5 mos
1,"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!",Ads ads and ads
1,"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",hate it
1,This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.,More ideal for a child or teen.
1,We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.,product works real well.
1,Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...,Very poor.
1,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!",NOT WORTH IT
1,This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back,dead
1,"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.",Won't unlock
1,I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.,Unable to use it
1,I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make),"8"" fire 16gb tablet"
1,I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .,Poor quality tablet
1,horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties,non functional!!!
1,Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed,App options pathetic
1,"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging.",Quit charging
1,"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product.",Does not work well for multiple children
1,It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together.,1.5 hours
1,I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired,Doesn't stay on
1,"Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless",horrible
1,"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store.","was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned"
1,"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.",Couldn't possibly hate it more.
1,Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device.,Poor charging
1,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,Horrible Battery Life
,"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more","Worth the money. Not perfect, but very very good for start to finish novels in good light"

,"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",Kindle vs. Nook (updated)

,"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more","Not the perfect do-it-all device, but very close to being the perfect e-reading device!"

,"I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes.",Kindle Customer Service vs. Comcast
,Great. Love it.,I love it
,"I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more",A hesistant buyer rejoices on his choice

,"I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product",Not a long-lasting product!

,"UPDATE: I bought both a Fire HD and a Gen 2. (as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the Kindle system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation Fire.The new Kindle Fire and Fire HD are the second generation color kindle e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original Fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The Fire HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Amazon but they really are solid feeling.- FIRE HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- FIRE GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the Fire. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE.Read more",Compare FIRE HD to the KINDLE FIRE GEN 2
,"I just received my kindle fire today. I had a hard time deciding between the HD, this, and the paperwhite. I decided on this one, because I really thought I'd like the immersion reading. I have an audible account and I've been reading along to the audiobooks. It's amazing how fast I can get through the books (at 3x speed) and I really retain the info. The immersion reading is super-easy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this. The whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time. I'm an average-speed reader and was able to read 4 books (with the help of the audiobook reading pace) in the last 30 days and one was the 800+ page Stephen king, 11/22/63.I also tested out the text to speech. It's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard. It also has many speed options and I think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version. I am very, very pleased with it.It is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire I'm upgrading from.If you are worried about the free offers, don't be. I DETEST commercials and advertising so much, I quit reading magazines and watching television. The offers only show on the startup, no big deal. I already took advantage of a 5.00 credit for amazon video. I was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and I was planning on renting Hunger Games tonight, anyway. So, so far, I don't mind the offers at all.My favorite feature is the immersion reading and the text-to-speech improvements. I also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.Read more",Best value
,"I purchased the Kindle Fire ten months ago for my daughter. Three weeks after she got it, it was stolen. Amazon worked with our police department to find the person who had taken it. Amazon first put a hold on the person's account and shut down the Kindle Fire so it wouldn't work. Then, once Amazon had a subpoena, Amazon gave the police all the information the thief had registered to my daughter's Kindle Fire and the police were able to recover it and get it back to us. Since that time, we have purchased an additional Kindle Fire and, just recently, a Kindle Fire HD. We use them like iPads at a fraction of the cost and the number of free books and apps available is unmatched by their competitors. Our oldest Kindle Fire (ten months old) just stopped charging and I contacted Amazon via Live Chat. Immediately, they said they would send me a replacement Kindle Fire and would also email me a printing label for free shipping to return the defective one. Their customer service is incredible! The Kindle Fire itself is amazing. The internet is fast connects perfectly to all wi-fi the graphics are clear and sharp the books and apps offered are endless. My teenager listens to Pandora on it constantly. I'm always reading. My husband checks the sports scores. My young sons are always playing the game apps. We have them protected in KlearKase protectors and have found them to be well-made, quality devices. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a Kindle Fire to anyone of my friends and family.",Wonderful product and incredible support from Amazon!
,"My 7 year old son has the 1st gen Kindle Fire, and we've been very happy with it. He mostly plays games on it now, but we plan to purchase more movies and books for it in the future. My 5 year old wanted one too, so we just purchased the 2nd gen Kindle Fire for her. She had been saving her allowance and birthday money this whole year for it. We purchased one the day they were announced!We've had it now for 3 days... and while it's still the same great product, we were disappointed to find (after receiving the device) that the 2nd generation Fire comes WITHOUT a wall charger (which the first gen Fire had) and has a whole mess of ads loaded onto it. My 5 year old can't read very well yet - she couldn't figure out how to get rid of the ads, and was constantly yelling for me to come help her. Also, some of the ads featured more mature themes (ads for sexy prime time tv shows, for example) that I would not want to expose my young child to.To purchase the wall charger, it cost us an extra 20, and it cost us 15 to have the ads turned off. So now we're up to 194 for the Kindle Fire that we thought we were getting for 159, plus a whole bunch of time wasted trying to figure out how to turn off the ads, and waiting for the wall charger to arrive.I am normally a HUGE Amazon fan, but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Would have given the device 4-5 stars on its own, but with the extra expenses and hassle, I have to take it down a couple stars.***Update Oct 10, 2012*** Interesting that many folks have taken my review as an opportunity to comment on my parenting skills. While I'm sure folks are well intentioned (sarcasm), I don't recall asking for parenting advice. Many have said it's ridiculous to buy an eReader for a child who can't read.Read more",Great product but they get you with the ads and missing accessories
1,This device is OK for reading or listening to audiobooks via Overdrive app. Wouldn't recommend it though really. Waited to buy Kindle for years. Would suggest doing research before buying this device.,Extremely slow

1,Screen was cracked but the package did arrive earlier than expected,Arrived broken
1,Purchased two of these tablets. Both of them had 4-7 dead pixels all over the screen. Read a lot of online reviews which stated same problem. The screen/resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for $50.,Ok tablet I must have got 2 bad ones
1,I don't like this tablet as Android is not working well,this is my worst purchase

1,"I bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. Also bought a screen shield & a 'kid proof' case. However, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it.

1,This tablet has little cpu power and is really only made to work with the Amazon Prime crowd. Not what I was looking for.,Only buy if a Amazon person.
1,"The item was on sale over the Christmas period at a great price. Took it home and when I charged it up, the back of the tablet became very hot to the touch and the battery life reduced dramatically. Left it alone, tried it again, this time no issues. Four days later, it did the same thing when I was charging it up again. Sent it back for a refund.","Great price, bad first experience"

1,"I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it.",Horrible

Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi. I even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. Maybe it was defaulty equipment. I sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. My other son sat right beside him had perfect Wifi.",Poorqualty
1,This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it.

1,"I totally love the Kindle Fire tablets purchased for my grandkids. My sister purchased one in our hometown for my mother. She is equally happy. My granddaughter and grandson spend their wind down time in the evening on the tablets playing their favorite games.

1,I don't have wi fi. so I can't use the device. I'm returning it. I wanted something that my father could use as an e reader.

1,"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????",Understand Warranty before throwing out $50

1,"Ouch. I bought this Fire tablet, and used it for about four hours, and left it on a charger. A couple of hours later, I picked up the tablet, and the screen was showing a weird 'ghosting' effect, and then the screen went completely black.I twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again, just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet.I'm sure I had a defective/damaged tablet, but I was underwhelmed with the quality, and it would be nice if Amazon brought back the higher quality HDX tablets, for people who don't mind paying more for quality tablets.",Amazon should bring back the HDX tablets

1,Except unlike the Millennium Falcon this doesn't have it where it counts. Software is a mess. I didn't expect much from a $50 tablet but man was it painful to use.,What a piece of junk
1,"fully understand this is a budget tablet, but the memory size and quality of screen are not to par",cheap feel
1,This thing is ok as long as you don't expect it to be or have stuff(Apps&Games) like Samsung or Apple cause it doesn't. It has its own line of ****,This thing blows
1,No longer takes charge from manufacture charger or any other type of charger. Product did not last very long since had 7 months.,poor quality
1,"Bought this for our daughter to use, but nothing worked right and was difficult to use. It's a fairly cheap $$ product, and it shows. Ended up returning it and buying a Samsung the next day.",Worst tablet we found
1,"I bought this tablet for my mother 12/7/15 as a Christmas gift, which I gave to her on the day 12/25. Just this week 1/8 she called to tell me that the tablet was not working right. I went to see her and check it out. Sure enough it wasn't functioning properly. I'm hoping that when I take it in, it will be replaced without a problem. I know sometimes items are just defective. That's why I would recommend this item. I've had my Kindle Fire for 3 years now with never a problem.",Damaged
1,"Bought 2, 1 did not work out of the box. Too slow, too much trouble to setup and requires amazon account to use. Returned both items",Not impressed
1,"Absolute junk, don't waste your money. Bought for wife for a Christmas gift. Would not connect to Wi-Fi at my house. Useless!",Junk
1,I bought this during Black Friday sales the price was very attractive but I didn't find it that attractive as YouTube stream was streaming slow it was taking 10-15 min to stream a single song.,Veer poor perform
1,Sold it on Craigslist the day I bought itWhat does that tell you.,lacking
1,Need Amazon account and bank account to use tablet. Bank card should be verified. Cheap product with terrible graphic. I returned that next day. Totally waste of money.,Waste of money
1,I bought this tablet because of the price and the specs seemed fine but it is slow it freezes and crashes I dont think it was a good buy,no good
1,You get wath you paid not comparable to a apple tablet never,Mm
1,"Bought this for my Mom as a gift and was really disappointed. This device DOES NOT RUN FULL ANDROID. You cannot get third party apps even though they sell it as tablet. This device is only good if you only use Amazon (shopping, books, games), otherwise you can't download anything - not even a weather app. Not worth my money to be so limited - Returned the device and got the Lenovo Tab 2 A7 and we are MUCH happier with it!","Glorified eReader, not a tablet"
1,"I purchased this tablet for my daughter and within 5 days after purchasing it, the screen went completely blank. It wasn't dropped and didn't get wet. It is also very limited to apps you can download on it. Many apps wouldn't work after being installed. I would NOT recommend buying this tablet.",Horrible tablet
1,I was setting up 2 of the same tablet and this one wouldn't connect to the wifi. When I brought it back for an exchange there were none in store and they didn't even have them on their website! Ended up getting a refund and purchasing the same model from Amazon,Didn't connect to wifi
1,Its ok tablet but you dont have access to all the same apps that are in google play store. Also to really enjoy the tablet you should be memebr of amazon prime which I am not.,NOT ENOUGH APPS
1,"This thing is a disaster. Unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life, you are in for disappointment. They've blocked the Google store, so good luck downloading most of the games you like. Youtube? owned by Google, so again, can't download the app. You CAN get there with the web browser, but why should you have to? I tried to download 3 games-- NONE of which would even load. In short, I owned it less than 16 hours. Waste of my time. Save your money and buy a Samsung Galaxy Tablet.",Wish I could give 0 stars

1,The kindle continues to freeze up when watching a movie. It will also freeze randomly.,Freezes up.
1,I thought this would be a good idea to buy my children. After I spoke with an associate at best buy and explained that I wanted this my my small children so they could play on YouTube he told me that it would work food for that. Well that was not the case I cannot ever get on you tube and my kids have not even used it after they initially tried.,very disappointed
1,"I ordered two of these tablets, one for 4 yr old, and another for mom. It is not user friendly, difficult to use and full of advertisements even when not online. Comes with games that kids enjoy, but very limited on other application options. Book ordering requires monthly subscriptions. We have purchased another product for mom, and the 4 yr old quickly got bored with the limited options, and I got frustrated trying to navigate.","Fine for kids, not for adults"
1,Did not work right out of the box; bad hard drive. Read other reviews that stated the same issue. Would not recommend to anyone. Save your money.,Amazon - Fire...you mean Fizzle.

1,Pretty tangerine color. First tablet had bad earphone jack; Second product would not connect to wifi no matter where we tried. All of our other tablets work fine.We will order another Amazon fire tablet.,2 identical tablets & 2 different problems
1,You cannot download any other internet service you're subject to very limited options to do things on it wish I could not have bought it,bad tablet
1,"I understand you get what you pay for but come on Amazon. You make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup. The only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust. In my opinion, if any company is going to integrate the AndroidOS at least make it user friendly and 100% open. It's basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device.",Waste of production funds by Amazon
1,Tablet was ok when it worked. Seemed to always have to reset our Wi-Fi at home for this one item. Everything else worked fine.,Has problems all the time connecting to WI_FI
1,"I've had amazon tablets in the past and this is the far worst I've bought. It was slow, drained the battery, kicking me out of the apps all the time.",ehhh

1,It was so slow and problematic i couldnt even get in to the store. Switched to a Samsung and we love it!,Returned it next day
1,"I bought this as a birthday gift a few weeks before the party. When it was removed from package and turned on, the image was cracked like the screen was broken, but screen was not broken. Best Buy washed their hands of it and said to call Amazon. I did and had to go through over a week's worth of calling them to get it replaced. Best Buy lost me as a customer over this.

1,"I purchased one as a Christmas gift. from Best Buy on line...it worked fine the first month,did not use it for a few weeks.

1,The kindle fire I purchased does not work. It does not start or charge.,Poor
1,Can not print from this device...Using the touch screen is very difficult.,Does not meet my needs
1,"I picked up this tablet thinking it would be a great buy. I have a few family members that own the previous model of the kindle fire and highly approve of them. The new product I got was very disappointing, The display had a dead pixel on it when I turned it on. The product is very slow and the cameras leave a lot to be desired. I took it back and exchanged for an IPad Mini 4 and am very happy with it.",A very disappointing Tablet
1,Luckily best buy exchanged the kindle fire for a Lenovo tablet with courtesy and ease. Thank you best buy! It was a black Friday purchase that I did nothing with until late January/ early February. Great way to do business and therefore keep it.,Terrible crashed after downloading apps
1,SPECIAL OFFERS means there are popup ads when you turn on the Kindle for games and books. I called amazon and they want me to pay $15.99 to turn this off! I am returning this and buying another brand of tablet. I am DONE with amazon they will never get a dime from me!,SPAM Edition
1,U thought it was going to be like an iPad or Samsung but it's all Amazon mode and you can't turn off the lock screen ads!!!! I get tired of seeing them...,Worse tablet I've ever bought.
1,"Bought these for my kids for the holidays. No you tube app installed, so you have to find a 3rd party substitute. Ads pop up all the time, with an option to remove them for $15. Amazon states that since I purchased the tablet on sale for $15, this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue. I would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt.Maybe a good product, but not for us.",A physical commercial
1,I bought the Fire for my 8 year old for school after a suggestion from the sales rep in store. Went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered. Couldn't even download free kids apps. Why would I want my child able to accidently buy something? I refused and thus not able to download anything. We will be returning it. Product appears best for an adult who likes to read books on tablet.,Not for kids

1,Gave as a Christmas gift. Recently learned that it stopped working within two weeks.,A great gift
1,"The tablet would never turn on, even after charging",Not Good
1,"Every time I open my amazon Fire, games pop up. It is very annoying. I have no interest in games. I do not play them. I did not purchase the item for games. I purchased my Fire for reading books, but it is very difficult to get to books. I go through a number of minutes and still do not accomplish the task that I want to do. I would like to know how to take off the games so I can do what I want to do.",good for listening to pandora.
1,Right out of the box it didn't work. We took it back and the Geek Squad couldn't get it to work either. Great disappointment for my 9 year old boy since it was a Christmas gift.,Didn't work
1,Very slow ...I guess it's worth the 40 bucks.. great product for a child..,Very slow..
1,"I bought this for my 3 year old, so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my iPad. Needless to say, she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the Netflix app, and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem. You really do get what you pay for. If you buy this, don't count on getting online very seamlessly. The Internet browser is really slow to use, but you can get around this by downloading Google Play store to access the Firefox app, which is not offered on the Amazon App Store. Check YouTube for instructions..",Frustrating to use
1,It was just the worst software I've ever seen you could barely play or do anything,Software
1,Bought it on thanksgiving night just opened pkg and the screen is crushed. Haven't been able to take it back but was told when I called in that they might not have any in stock.,Broke
1,"This 7"" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. It's like a very ""dumbed"" down, cheap version of the better FireHD and HDX. Screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to TV and it's slooowww as can be. If you've never owned another kind of Kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one. I got mine on Black Friday for a little over $30. total with shopping discounts and I'm still sending it back! That's how disappointed I am with it.",I don't recommend it.
1,Was not a fan of this product Browsers are extremely slow,Great for books that's about it!
1,"We bought this Kindle Fire for our autistic grandson. He seemed to fight with it trying to connect to the internet. After 3 adults tried and tried to connect it to the internet, it finally connected. Every time he comes to our house, we have to fight again to get it connected. We decided this was not the unit for him or any other kid. So, its back to the mini I-Pad.",Not for a beginner.

It is impossible to use google account.Even You can log in gmail account.2. Bad for web surfing. There are so many limits for web surfing.3.This issue is only for Koreans. It is impossible to type & see Korean language.Do not buy this tablet if you are Korean.I do not know why this tablet does not support Korean. Even supports other Asian countries languages as like Chinese, Japanese. Etc....",Price is low. Quality is lower than others..
1,The kids were loving these as Christmas gifts but here we are 6 months later and the battery charging port barely even works. We have to hold the charging cable at a certain angle for it to even charge. I wasn't expecting a super long life out of these tablets at $39.99 a pop but should've lasted longer than 5-6 months. Very upset with 4 sad kiddos.,Battery Port Sucks
,"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",Works great with one critical flaw. (significantly improved)
,"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!","A review from a non-techie 11,059 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No"

,"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):br /br /First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).br /br /The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.br /br /I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.br /br /WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.br /br /Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV.

1,I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.,Charging Port Does Not Last - Not good for kids!

The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets.

I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.",I do not like this tablet. Period.
1,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor,Disappointed
1,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",Chronic issue with charging port

1,"Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas.",Had to return this on Christmas eve day
1,"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing.",Don't like...too hard to download other apps
1,"I am really disappointed in this Kindle....I have had many kindles, but I wanted somwthing I thoughtnwould be simple. This kindle doesn't show all my books that are in my cloud..it doesn't matter that they aren't in my device but they should still show up in my cloud...I have to go to my amazon account and transfer the book I want to my device.",Great for someone who doesn't have alot of books
1,Paper white does not allow you do use books from the library as you cannot load apps. Only books from Amazon are available to read.,Unable to access library
1,Our daughter loves the size and portability of the product. Her iPad died and she uses her Mac book for school so this was a great choice for her to read books on.,Gift for our college daughter
1,"I purchased this ereader because it stated you could get library booksvia USB cord (and Wifi if you are near one). I do not have Wifi andthe USB would not transfer. Tried everything, neighbor tried, readinstructions, viewed YouTube. But it wouldn't work. Took it back but it was beyond 15 days and they would only give me credit. I then upgraded to Wifi 3g and that better work for the extra money. Very disappointed as I felt I had no other choice.",Transfer library books via USB
1,I took it back the day after purchasing it. The screen looks like you are scrolling through old news print. Blacks out each moment you move it. I thought it was a defect but nope. According to the geek squad that's just the way it is now :(,Terrible operation
1,"We started out great. We had a great thing going. I loved her, she was easy on the eyes, and looked great in any light. Then 7 months into it, I could no longer turn her on. I tried the reboot with no luck. She is still under warranty but that doesn't matter because Best Buy's return policy stinks. If I do try to replace her, I will not buy it here.",Started out great
1,"Not for the average computer person. Very confusing instructions. I spent several hours trying to install the ""overdrive"" so I could get e-books from the library. Ran the battery down several times with no luck. I got so disgusted I had to just put it down. (I'm still trying because I refuse to give up) Thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too!)",I found it very difficult to set up.
1,"I HATE this machine. First, I specifically asked the salesperson if I could connect to the internet. He assured me I could. It does not. Second complaint is that you can't just press the book and delete it. You have to go to Amazon to do this. I hated it so much I gave it away.",Horrible product
1,"Used it for 2 days and the screen froze 5 times--the kindle just won't switch on. Had to restart each time, and sometimes restarting won't help. It is clearly defective. Brought it to a Bestbuy store to exchange, but custumer service won't replace it. Asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. Then they said they could give me store credit, and I would go line up in checkout and order a new one. Since I got mine on a discount, I had to pay the price difference!! This is ridiculous. They wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless I pay more?? Got a refund in the end even though I liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange. I guess purchases with discounts are not protected.",Defective and store won't exchange
1,"Asked a Bestbuy employee if I could connect to my library. He told me yes so I bought the Kindle. When I got it home, found out that downloading books from my library was not an option, so I returned Kindle.",Disappointed
1,"Easy to use, load books and to read in out door light conditions. Very light to hold and read.",Excellent e reader in all light conditions.
1,I eventually had to return it because of the shades of yellow in the back-light when using it at night. It was okay at day time but at night during which I usually read it was not what i expected to be premium cost product. Especially it was very annoying to read in the landscape mode. I guess Amazon needs a better QA department.,Defective Product
1,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",Device failed after two uses
1,"My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",Amazon Voyage dead trying to update software

,"My previous kindle was a DX, this is my second kindle in years. Love the form factor and all but I do miss the physical buttons for page turning. There is a glitch in the software though. I use the English interface but occasionally I would like to translate words into traditional Chinese. However, it seems that the traditional Chinese characters cannot display correctly and become small boxes. The simplified Chinese characters can be displayed correctly though.",Great device for reading. 8 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No
,"Just got mine right now. Looks the same as the previous generation except for the Kindle logo (it's black this time), feels a little heavier, the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one, BUT the resolution is SO MUCH BETTER! The 300 ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money.Totally recommend it for a book lover!I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am used to a cooler screen, but I'm sure I'll get used to this one soon too :)",Definitely better than the previous generation 16 people found this helpful.

,"As reviewed by the wife This is the perfect thing for a new mommy who loves to read books! As soon as I had my baby girl, I had to stop reading my novels because I had to give the baby my full attention. But how much time do I spend laying in bed, on my side, with the baby while she feeds Especially prior to 4 months when feeding took as long as 45 minutes! Not to mention cluster feeds during growth spurts! A book was out of the question because it's sooo tiring to hold up in side-lying-breastfeeding-position. My new Kindle was the solution! It's light, easy to disinfect (I use baby wipes on the case whenever I feel like it's not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby) and you don't need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing - you know what I mean!And for some reason it's much easier to go through a book with a Kindle compared to an actual book.

,"My new Kindle Paperwhite came from the USA to a small town in Sweden in just five days. Payment of tax and customs handled by Amazon. Had not the UPS been so square (they think everyone sits at home all day) I had received it a day earlier.I am very pleased with the e-reader, easy on the eyes, and comfortable to hold in one hand. Even if I buy many books from Amazon I also want to read books in the ePub format. A positive surprise was how easy it is to convert ePub format to Amazon's own format. I use the program Calibre and then I just send the book as an attachment in an e-mail to my Kindle.

1,"I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE",Disappointed

1,"Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :).","Purchase a new one, stay away from the refurbished fire tv."
1,"I bought this thinking since we'd bought several other refurbished things that worked, that it would be okay. The box never booted properly so the only thing we could stare at was the Amazon logo and the words Unknown Boot in the corner. Customer Service tried to help with the box but we couldn't get it to trouble shoot. Sending this box back.",Never booted
1,"Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something.",Certified Garbage!
1,"Hopefully, this will at least work as an e-reader. Otherwise, Amazon has it locked up so tight one cannot do much else with it.

1,We got this for our son. He is always wanting to play on Mom's tablet so we thought this would be a good choice. His aunt does a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one.

1,"Found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing comes with it. It's a listening device in my home that won't do anything unless I pay more into Amazon. The fact that I synced my pandora account is pointless because I have to spell out what I want Alexa to play by saying, ""Alexa play 'X' station from my pandora play list."" How is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when I am the only one who knows my pandora play list (and barely at that!) I have many complaints, and basically disappointed in my purchase. I was lead to believe this was the radio of the future. It is if I pay for the Amazon Music Unlimited monthly.",purchased without research unimpressed
1,This device plays on the fact that you must subscribe to their stuff or this is just a empty cylinder that tells you the weather and that's it.

1,Great Servive Best Buy and the price match is great I used it both at best buy,Good functioal product

1,This product not good waste of money I would recommend it,Not good
1,Alexa answers maybe 1 out of 10 questions we ask her - she uses Bing.com and it is really bad. Her standard answer is - I don't know the answer to this question. We ask her easy questions about stats or people. We also have a Google home and it answers almost every question right.,does not perform like advertised
1,"Not as easy as it sounded like it was going to be. So many things to buy to get full use out of what we knew we COULD do. Every question we seem to ask Alexa/she says she doesn't know the answer and that we'd have to ""download the app"" - so we never use her/only to ask her to set a timer and tell us the time and ask her to play music, which we also had to set up first.

2,Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes,short life
2,"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated.

2,"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad.",Returned it.. SLOW!!!
2,"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging","Tablet nice, not so nice battery though"
2,This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.,Just ok

2,I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.,Has potential.
2,"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service.",Color difference is HUGE. Bad customer service.
2,"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.",Disappointed

2,"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!","This tablet was nice, but..."
2,"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.","Disappointed with device, Mfg, and seller"
2,"The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great.",FireHD 8
2,"If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to.",Does the job most of the time

2,"My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one.","Watching videos, great..then.."

,"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more","Worth the money. Not perfect, but very very good for start to finish novels in good light"

,"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",Kindle vs. Nook (updated)

,"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed.

I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.br /br /My overall impression of the device is good.br /br /The good:br /I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.br /br /The so-so:br /The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more","Worth the money. Not perfect, but very very good for start to finish novels in good light"
,"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:br /br /My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.br /br /Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.br /br /The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.br /br /I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.br /br /The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.br /br /For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",Kindle vs. Nook (updated)
,"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more","Not the perfect do-it-all device, but very close to being the perfect e-reading device!"

,"All of them quit working. There's absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw",I've had 3!
,"I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes.",Kindle Customer Service vs. Comcast
,Great. Love it.,I love it
,"I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more",A hesistant buyer rejoices on his choice

Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with.",Ruined my marriage
,"I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product",Not a long-lasting product!

,"Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions.

,"UPDATE: I bought both a Fire HD and a Gen 2. (as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the Kindle system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation Fire.The new Kindle Fire and Fire HD are the second generation color kindle e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original Fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The Fire HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Amazon but they really are solid feeling.- FIRE HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- FIRE GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the Fire. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE.Read more",Compare FIRE HD to the KINDLE FIRE GEN 2
,"I just received my kindle fire today. I had a hard time deciding between the HD, this, and the paperwhite. I decided on this one, because I really thought I'd like the immersion reading. I have an audible account and I've been reading along to the audiobooks. It's amazing how fast I can get through the books (at 3x speed) and I really retain the info. The immersion reading is super-easy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this. The whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time. I'm an average-speed reader and was able to read 4 books (with the help of the audiobook reading pace) in the last 30 days and one was the 800+ page Stephen king, 11/22/63.I also tested out the text to speech. It's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard. It also has many speed options and I think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version. I am very, very pleased with it.It is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire I'm upgrading from.If you are worried about the free offers, don't be. I DETEST commercials and advertising so much, I quit reading magazines and watching television. The offers only show on the startup, no big deal. I already took advantage of a 5.00 credit for amazon video. I was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and I was planning on renting Hunger Games tonight, anyway. So, so far, I don't mind the offers at all.My favorite feature is the immersion reading and the text-to-speech improvements. I also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.Read more",Best value
,"I purchased the Kindle Fire ten months ago for my daughter. Three weeks after she got it, it was stolen. Amazon worked with our police department to find the person who had taken it. Amazon first put a hold on the person's account and shut down the Kindle Fire so it wouldn't work. Then, once Amazon had a subpoena, Amazon gave the police all the information the thief had registered to my daughter's Kindle Fire and the police were able to recover it and get it back to us. Since that time, we have purchased an additional Kindle Fire and, just recently, a Kindle Fire HD. We use them like iPads at a fraction of the cost and the number of free books and apps available is unmatched by their competitors. Our oldest Kindle Fire (ten months old) just stopped charging and I contacted Amazon via Live Chat. Immediately, they said they would send me a replacement Kindle Fire and would also email me a printing label for free shipping to return the defective one. Their customer service is incredible! The Kindle Fire itself is amazing. The internet is fast connects perfectly to all wi-fi the graphics are clear and sharp the books and apps offered are endless. My teenager listens to Pandora on it constantly. I'm always reading. My husband checks the sports scores. My young sons are always playing the game apps. We have them protected in KlearKase protectors and have found them to be well-made, quality devices. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a Kindle Fire to anyone of my friends and family.",Wonderful product and incredible support from Amazon!
,"My 7 year old son has the 1st gen Kindle Fire, and we've been very happy with it. He mostly plays games on it now, but we plan to purchase more movies and books for it in the future. My 5 year old wanted one too, so we just purchased the 2nd gen Kindle Fire for her. She had been saving her allowance and birthday money this whole year for it. We purchased one the day they were announced!We've had it now for 3 days... and while it's still the same great product, we were disappointed to find (after receiving the device) that the 2nd generation Fire comes WITHOUT a wall charger (which the first gen Fire had) and has a whole mess of ads loaded onto it. My 5 year old can't read very well yet - she couldn't figure out how to get rid of the ads, and was constantly yelling for me to come help her. Also, some of the ads featured more mature themes (ads for sexy prime time tv shows, for example) that I would not want to expose my young child to.To purchase the wall charger, it cost us an extra 20, and it cost us 15 to have the ads turned off. So now we're up to 194 for the Kindle Fire that we thought we were getting for 159, plus a whole bunch of time wasted trying to figure out how to turn off the ads, and waiting for the wall charger to arrive.I am normally a HUGE Amazon fan, but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Would have given the device 4-5 stars on its own, but with the extra expenses and hassle, I have to take it down a couple stars.***Update Oct 10, 2012*** Interesting that many folks have taken my review as an opportunity to comment on my parenting skills.

2,"When i opened this tablet there was a white line in the bottom corner of the screen. Everything worked fine but that line was bothering me. I returned it to the store and got a replacement but it had another white line. Other than that it was a good tablet, it is very affordable",Screen can be improved
2,"Worked good for a month, the kids loved it but then just went black and wouldn't come back on. Sending it back to get a new one with the warranty.",Fun while it lasted!
2,Don't like all the ads. Didn't know that they would be permanent because I bought it on sale. It's very slow and has trouble connecting to my wifi.,Eh
2,You get what you pay for. It works but is very slow.,You get what you pay for.
2,I purchased this for my mother in law. She is getting old and wanted something she could see.The font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something. It really wasn't a good fit for her.The device died approximately 1 week after purchase. We returned it for a refund.,Dead within the week.
2,Quality of screen display is lacking and the reason I returned the tablet. For adult users I cannot recommend.,Good tablet for children.
2,"Amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. That one works so overall the Fire was a good purchase. Recommend a memory card, it does not hold much.","It was faulty, had to contact Amazon"
2,Not many apps I'd use. Not as useful as I'd hoped.,Good for kindle
2,"the internet server SILK is not compatible with free wifi on southwest airlines and I bought it to use on the plane. also I cannot hear the audio even with the sound all the way up on the plane. so I don't really need it since I have a computer , iPhone and kindle at home.",i can't use this on the airplane
2,Although a cheap tablet with amazon functionality it's a very slow one.,Get what you pay for
2,Nice tablet for children - Works well as a gift for the price,Amazon Tablet
2,Didn't know that Amazon had control over everything. Should have bought any other tablet.,Don't like
2,"The one purchased at Best Buy had black and gray lines appearing across the screen when powering up. It got worse, to occurring while using it. Amazon was contacted via Chat and determined something was wrong, and exchanged it. The replacement from Amazon is working, so for this I will mark, ""Yes"" to recommend it.","It was faulty, had to contact Amazon"
2,T-r-a-s-h.............................................. ....,Good price
2,It is a nice little tablet for on the go or for kids. Wouldn't recommend using it for work,Ok
2,"We bought the tablet for work, but the only app we needed (free) never would download. After many tries and several hours, we gave up and took it back to the store.",Not able to downloan app
2,"My daughter got this for Christmas. Right out of the box it came on, but the screen was all white. Good price, but could never get it to work.",No screen
2,"From the first time I used it, the pages kept freezing and didn't respond to touch commands. I had to turn it off and back on daily. I tried to get a replacement and was told they no longer have them and I'd have to pay $10. more for a newer model. I bought 2 (1 as a gift). So far 1 works and 1 didn't.",quirky and freezes
2,"I bought this tablet on Black Friday and it was on sale. It's incredibly slow, and the screen quality is mediocre. What bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet. I only really use it to watch Netflix- so it's fine, but don't expect anything above that to function well on this device.",You get what you pay for.
2,I would never buy another Amazon product personally. It works well but I'd rather use the rca over this. Personal preference has nothing to do with quality,Poor
2,"In my personal opinion, this product would be unable to satisify any adult, whether it was for business or pleasure. Limited apps, limited space, slow uploading, etc. Also, due to this being an amazon product, many apps and options are unavailable, that are commonly used with both android and apple products. So I would not recommend to anyone.",I would recommend for small children.
2,Gave tablet as a Christmas gift - she uses it all of the time and loves it. She was thrilled to get it I bought the extended warranty so that the tablet would be covererd in case something happened to it. Her mother had seen it advertised and I bought it on thanksgiving day,It was a gift for a grandchild
2,Cheap but biggest problem is I can't get it to download apps. The Internet connection is very weak.,I little disappointment
2,"Nice, clear images, but very slow and the ads on the start screen are annoying. Also, the search engine, Silk, is not very good. Switch to Google if you can. Should have just stuck with the Digiland tablet--a lot more bang for the buck.",not the best
2,"There is not enough battery life to read comfortably. 7 hours, maybe.",not satisfied
2,"I will not recommend this one, do slow and I ended up returning this product",This is slow
2,The Kindle I purchased is a good and expensive tablet useful for reading and internet. It does have a lot of apps already loaded that I do not plan to use and do not know how to delete. I mainly use the Kindle Fire for Facebook and occasionally get on the internet.,Good tablet for reading and internet
2,Not the best and the brightest in the market. Bought two of them and one got damaged within the second month. Best buy was not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair. Good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long.,Average product
2,Price is nice but performance was not. Sluggish to the point of frustration even to my 4 year old. Would be fine as ereader or maybe basic web device.,You get what you pay for
2,Don't like that Amazon has so many ads going on this thing. Makes it pretty not fun to use.,Too many ads
2,I felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader,Very basic
2,Could not get this to work with my chromecast so I returned it.,Based off of Chrome Cast
2,I purchased 3 kindles for my grandchildren for Christmas last year. I have been very disappointed with their quality. The chargers were very difficult to plug in right from the beginning and now one of the kindles won't even charge at all. The others have to be positioned just right or they won't charge either. I definitely would not recommend this particular model kindle to anyone.,Disappointing
2,"I bought my son a kindle about 6 months ago and it was great.... Until my husband dropped it and broke the screen. So I bought my son another one last week, but I think it might be defective becuz the battery died not fully charge or it takes a super long time to charge, where this did not happen with my last one",Great for kids
2,This product is a great product as long as the plug-in charge port doesn't break and quit taking a charge.,Good Product as long as you can keep it working.
2,"I have had several kindles, this latest one just doesnt seem to be as good of quality as the previous onrs i have owned",Pictute quality and performance low
2,I love dis tablet just wish the screen wasn't crack!,It's ok
2,"Not as good as i though, but at least it does what it is suppoused. Very bad screen quality",Good
2,"I bought this tablet to read Free Epub books that I have, but it didn't allow me to even look for the books, so I have it returned and exchanged for a cheaper one that still does a better job for those who wants to read free Epub books",Not for those who wants to read free ePub books
2,"I use this to read things and purchase items on Amazon. It doesn't play all of my favorite games from the App Store, nor does it sync to my android projector, so I don't really get full use of the larger screen. I think for my uses, I should've just purchased the e-ink version or maybe a full-android version.",Android-lite
2,Purchased the Kindle fire fir my grandfaughter and she loved it. It was so easy for her to use. The size was perfect http://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/,Granddaughter loved it
2,This table is okay for me. But it is great for kids,Okay
2,"I got this tablet with high expectations given it's from Amazon. However it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.First off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. Too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.The deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a VPN using the regular Android settings. The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of ""Google Play Store"" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad! I really wanted to like it.",Cheap but faulty. Not what I was expecting.
2,"The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. If you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from Amazon, there is no Google Play to get more app selection.True, you can try to side load the Google Apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. Also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the iPad Mini or other decent Android slates. I'd recommend a Samsung tablet or an iPad before I would recommend this, unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money.",Alright tablet for the price
2,"It works but it takes a while to do anything. But for the price, it's good enough for the kids.",It works but it's slow
2,"The price may be attractive, but not worth to buy. After seeing tabs like iPad, Nexus and others, you wouldn't be willing to use it as the display is just 1024 x 600 pixels, touch is not very smooth, not so good customized apps/games (though there is a way to install all Android apps). The build quality is good though.",Not a good tab though at a low price
2,Has tons of free games for the kids not so good for the average tablet user as its not that powerful but I guess that's only my opinion,Great for kids
2,"I looked at the reviews and they varied greatly. I didn't want an electric sharpener, so my choices were very limited. This pencil sharpener is adequate and suits my needs because I don't use pencils very often, but it is very slow and sounds like it's straining.",Fair product for the price
2,Slow with limited application. Battery doesn't last long and the download speed is less than expected.,Ok for the money but wouldnt do it over.
2,"Compared to an equally inexpensive RCA tablet, this one has more limitations in the apps you can get. I was disappointed in its utility and prefer the RCA tablet over this one.",Not a great tablet platform
2,I bought 3 of them as gifts for my nephews. It was really disapproval to learn that they were already linked to my Amazon account. I started getting notices everything's they downloaded something. I had to literally unlink everyone one of them from my account before they made a big purchase (which they did purchase Amazon Prime-which I cancelled because I wasn't ready for a $100 purchase).,Some issues
2,Was unable to get to google docs on this one even though the sales person said we would be able to. My Granddaughter needed this for school & it did not allow you to get to google docs.,Had to exchange this one
2,"It all depends on what your using a 50 dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device. It is better for light use on the safe side use for 5h a day. 8h a day battery is the average, but runs down faster and over heats when playing a 3D game. But if u are on tight budget it is useful. ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals( which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores). And other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there.",Terrible but managable
2,"The processor is very slow. The tablet is great for reading books and ordering stuff from Amazon, but it is really slow opening aps. Pay more to get the better processor.",Mediocre Tablet
2,"For the money, this tablet is an amazing piece of hardware. Well constructed, good fit and finish, good battery life.BUT putting non-Amazon software on the tablet is a pain, a real pain.I purchased this for my granddaughter and wanted two things, (1) YouTube and (2) Skype. It took about 2 hours to put these two apps on the tablet. In the end, I returned the tablet and purchased an Insignia (BB house brand) tablet instead.",If you can live within Amazon's ecosystem
2,Didn't like the return policy on this item. I couldn't purchase insurance on it in the store.,I had not had the item more than a week and it wa.
2,"I got this so my son would have something to watch movies on while on a long car trip. It does that, barely. The $50 I spent for it was worth it. If you get an SD card for it you can load and watch movies. The Wi-Fi sucks and it sometimes doesn't stream movies from Netflix. Forget about YouTube.",Not the best
2,"This version of kindle was not very impressive to me. Navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. Also I have had an issue with charging on this device since I purchased it. When it does accept the charge it will charge to 100% rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. At times when I am using I will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well & keeps falling out. I even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not.",Prefer using previous kindle
2,This really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck. I bought this for about $35 just to kill time on a couple of long flights so I didn't wear out the battery on my phone. I definitely wouldn't recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at. I only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so I got what I wanted out of it.,Worth what I paid
2,"It is an ok tablet. As I am using it, I lose my page quite often and have to go back to find it again. Also, I lose internet connection or am unable to connect at all. For the money, I find it acceptable but not ideal.",Not that easily navigated.
2,I loved the kindle. But it took one small fall about 3 feet and half of the lcd screen broke. It's ruined I knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor???,The camera is good for the price
2,Too slow for me. You tube don't work sometimes. Able to download some books from amazon prime.,Too slow for me
2,"I've been using a Kindle forever, and when it became apparent I needed an Android device (I have a Windows phone, which I love but has serious app limitations) I thought I with a Fire I could get a tablet and upgrade my Kindle at the same time. But even with Geek Squad help I could never figure out how to upload the apps I needed onto the Fire. So back it went, replaced with a Lenovo tablet that does the trick.",Not a real tablet
2,Cheap tablet but solid built. Weak audio and poor camera.,Cheap tablet
2,I bought this tablet and returned it the same day. The only reason why I bought it in the first place was so I could play certain games with it but it turned out that the games were not supported on this device.,Nice while I had it
2,"This would be a great deal due to the good price for an better than entry level Android tablet... but... it is impossible to play music from Google play on it. Only Amazon! That's ok, since is their business, but should make that cleat to not waste time to buy and return it :(If you have a short budget and don't care about being attached to amazon only, this tablet is for you.",Nobody told it doen't like Google services.
2,"everything started out great, but then about 9 days into owning the fire, could not locate wifi, doesn't work without wifi",Started out great
2,Nothing special and not much memory but for $40 it is worth the price,Inexpensive
2,The processor was so slow. It took about five minutes to load a five minute YouTube video with 50 Mb/min. Internet.,Good for kids
2,I have been a kindle user for years and I expect a certain level of quality. This version falls short. Constantly freezes.,Dissatisfied
2,This is embarrassing. I purchased one game from amazon app store. The app crashed right away after I started it. I don't know how Amazon tested all these apps on their own device. But the experience is really bad.,Cannot play one game I purchased from Amazon Store
2,"Good value for the price, though a little slow loading some apps.",Great price
2,Took around 2 and a half days for the you tube to start the video.... But its decent enough once it started... You can never be sure when it is gonna work and when not,Decent enough for its price if it works!!!
2,"This is way to complicated for kids, my kid was frustrated trying to figure it out",Not For Kids
2,I purchased this as a after thought. The tablet has 8gb but from the moment you start to use it almost five is already used by Amazon I was totally disappointed. I love how the screen savers changed though it was so clear and unique but the memory took the cake for me!,Ugh worst ever! No memory
2,It contains too many adds that cant be removed including the lock screen its not worth the money,The amazon fire tablet 7
2,"Not much need for this thing, good price, but makes one wonder if they were on sale because they really don't do much and it would make a good gift for a youngster just getting started with a tablet. Not impressed at all.",Give away
2,"It is tough to use these tablets if you are use to Apple products. Internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the Amazon programs it is running. Everytime my kids play a game, the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory. I would not recommend these tablets for anything more that an e-book reader.",Not what we thought they were
2,Wanted a cheap tablet to read books and comics. I found the lack of apps to be disappointing. It seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy books from amazon or to buy apps.,You get what you pay for.
2,"It's cheap so I didnt expect it to be amazing, nor am I disappointed, it's great for streaming video. Even better with chromecast.",Slow Tablet
2,Didn't think it is well made the product ask for too many sign up,Didn't like the camera took bad pictures
2,Speakers sound real low Not easy to use at allHave to pay for everything,It's ok
2,Love everything about the unit except that it gets hot when used for 10 to 15 minutes. Hope it doesn't burn or explode.,Acceptable for the price
2,Purchased for my kids but it was hard to navigate and ended up with purchasing an iPad,It was average
2,"I bought this on Black Friday, simply because it was dirt cheap. It works ok but kinda slow.",Its ok for the price
2,I hope to have it set up for my disabled daughter sooon,good for beginners
2,Every time it was turned on and Every time I went to the Internet I had advertisement. If I'm going to pay money for something I certainly don't want advertisement along with it. If it were free okay fine advertise to me.The advertisement could not be shut off. I returned it.,Too much advertisement
2,"I purchased this for my husband to play his games on(clash of clans). The BB salesperson assured me he would be able to use it for that. Got it home, turns out you can only use/gets apps from the Amazon store which does not include games like clash of clans. It was already opened and set up so I gave it to my 6 yr old. He plays a few games on it and watches some movies, but would much rather play with the iPad.","So,so"
2,"We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee ""compatibility"" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.",Does not work with WowWee MiP app
2,"Ok for a beginner or young person, or someone just learning the technology.",Ok for a beginner
2,Decent product. Not so much if you're used to android software. You can't get your photos saved in google. More than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted. Basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor. Exchanged it for am android tablet,Maybe if you like to read digital books
2,"Pros:InexpensiveExpandable storageGood for Amazon Prime members and Amazon shoppersCons:Slow/sluggish performanceLack of apps (no YouTube, Instagram etc)Some available apps crash or can not be installedTouch screen freezesScreen resolution is not sharp or bright, greenish hueToo many links/ads to buy thingsSound quality is not goodWiFi onlyConclusion:For the price the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet is good for those who want an eReader that can also access email, Facebook and Amazon Prime but the lack of apps, cheap construction and buggy performance keep it from being a good, full-featured tablet.","As they say, you get what you pay for"
2,"The resolution on the games is not good. I didn't even try to watch Netflix because i knew it wouldn't show clearly. Also, it is slow using the internet. I assumed it would look and work like Android but i wrong. Everything is Amazon which i am unfamiliar with. Honestly, it is better for reading books. I returned for something more diverse and better.",Awesome for avid book readers
2,"Bought this tablet this Thanksgiving for $35.Tablet is too slow and apps doesn't responds properly, tried doing the updates over wifi to see if that resolves the issue but that didn't work too.Commons apps like Gmail, Facebook, Messenger or browser related are dying very frequently and sometimes doesn't even boots up, also, coming from Android you will feel that you have landed up in a deserted apps land.A good tablet for kids but adults can't rely on it !",Price is good but not worth !
2,"I didn't expect a lot at this price, but I also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with dead/stuck pixels right out of the box. I have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that I am at least good for 1/3. Waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for return/replacement just in case that one needs to go as well. Maybe just bad luck, but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a return.Everything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues, but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been corrected.I am sure if you don't have these display issues that the product deserves more than 2 stars, but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being. If the display did not have these pixel issues I could see this easily being a 4 Star recommendation. If you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others, so this is not just a rare incident. If it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location, do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home. :)",Dead/Stuck Pixels Galore!
2,Ok tablet...decent size screen & graphics. Was hoping I could mirror my phone to it but it doesn't have miracast.,Good tablet for kids
2,Not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up. Not a big fan of the online tutorial. Had a really hard time in powering it off. Camera setting did not take very good pictures. DID NOT LIKE THE MULTIPLE ADS ON IT EVERY TIME I USED IT. FINALLY IT LOCKED UP ON ME AND I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO GO TO SETTINGS SO I COULD DO ANYTHING WITH IT. Probably will be returning this product to Best Buy.,Not happy with the overall performance of product.
2,This product is a beginner product for Kids and nothing to be of use for Elders,Product for Kids and not for Elders
2,"First, bought it 15 days before it went on sale everywhere. Next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay $15 to disable them. Performance is slow; keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. Watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. It drops WiFi more than I'm used to. Have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. Good battery kifre, but Quite slow to recharge. Sometimes the ""keys"" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. Thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.I got $50 worth of tablet.Compared to the look and feel of my old iPad, its like I'm still using a VCR and everyone else is on blue ray.",Exactly $50 worth of tablet
2,just bought it and not really happy i really expected more from amazon,good price
2,"Apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing. I'm telling you, generic tablets are faster... I thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. I first noticed this after I started using it but I thought I would give it a shot. I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand. The games are nice and mostly ad free. It uses Android 5.0 but uses their own app store. Reading books is great. Library app is kinda slow but still works.Perfect cheap tablet for kids age 6 to 13 maybe...",A nice tablet for books. That's really it.
2,the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data. Perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later SW update but for now I have to say the performance is underwhelming. the Backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship. The fire 7 HD which i also own has none of these issues. Get what you pay for rings true again.,Cheap but appears Wifi is inadequate
2,"The Fire 7 has a great price! You get your money's worth. However, you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one. The one I bought had a busted pixel in the screen. There was no damage to the case or glass screen, but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen's image. I've owned multiple, but I have never had this problem before with an ePad tablet when I just bought it. I will now have to visit Best Buy again tomorrow for an exchange. I'm hoping they're still in stock. It's not Best Buy's fault. The fault lies with Amazon. They're clearly not that durable.",Damaged Screen
2,I got this to replace the iPad for a child. I am so disappointed by the charge. It dies so quickly and the charger has to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge. This was after 2 weeks of having the tablet. Low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment!,Disappointed
2,Bought this for my daughter and she didn't care for it when it came to the apps. Works great for reading.,Slow tablet
2,very slow device for most adults. probably fine for a child,very slow
2,Use it a lot for listening to audio books. Too many ads.,OK - wish it didn't have all the ads
2,"My granddaughter used her phone constantly to play games and when she needed to make a call phone is dead. Now with tablet, she FaceTime me more and her phone now keep a chatge.",Excellent game for 8year old
,"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",Works great with one critical flaw. (significantly improved)
,"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more.

I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.br /br /Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.br /br /The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.br /br /I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.br /br /Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content.Read more",Works great with one critical flaw. (significantly improved)
,"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):br /br /First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).br /br /The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.br /br /I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.br /br /WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.br /br /Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Read more",This box is a GAME CHANGER for on demand content! Amazon knocked it out of the park.

2,The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.,The size is great for taking on the road
2,Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.,Operating system.
2,Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.,Good as long as it is plugged in to outlet.
2,"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money",Piece of junk
2,Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.,Too small
2,"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps",Not a huge fan
2,"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet.","I bought it for travel, but barely used it."
2,"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.",Its gd if you like amazon
2,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.,Okay tablet
2,It's a good device for children because they don't know any better,Good for kids
2,"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so.","Slow, Not enough apps, Tumblr Doesn't work"
2,"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows.",Disappointed
2,I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.,Not what I need.
2,I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..,No good
2,"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy.",Unfortunate
2,"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery.",Tablet will not charge

2,"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!","Does the job, but way overpriced"
2,"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating.",Nice but problematic
2,The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.,Charging plug
2,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all",Disappointed doesn't play Netflix

2,"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight.","I expected limitations, I got limitations"
2,I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.,POOR QUALITY
2,"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing",Kept freezing
2,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc.",It's ok

I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product.

2,"Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!",Disappointing product.
2,Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.,Just ok...
2,When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.,not kid friendly
2,"I received an email asking if I would like to give my review and I am glad that I did. I purchased this less than 2 months ago and it has already quit working. It will not charge and it will no longer power on. All I have is a black screen. When it did work, it dropped internet quite frequently and froze several times during use. I would not recommend this product.",Very disappointed
2,Hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on.,Hard to set up
2,The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.,Not as happy as I thought
2,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad.",Okay

2,I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.,Not much useful
2,Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating,Okay.
2,Bought it for my 5 yr old daughter and for some reason it did not work. This is the second time I've purchased this and had to return it. So I will get her a mini iPad. Never again will I waste my time and money.,Horrible Item
2,Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!,Maybe better for younger kids
2,"Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. I will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product",Regular Tablet
2,"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much.

I had to go through being on hold FOREVER to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an IMMEDIATE turn-off. I don't find it to page-turn handle as well as my OLD ORIGINAL NOOK OR NOOK COLOR and certainly not anything like the Ipad Mini. If I hadnt kept it too long to return I would have. It doesn't auto correct to landscape then portrate, nope you have to MANUALLY CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER AND GOING BACK AND FORTH IS just stupid...it should have been part of the IMPROVED design, THEY REALLY MISSED THE MARK FOR THE PRICE. i CAN GET A FULL TABLET FOR LESS MONEY THAT DOES ALL THAT AND SIMPLY USE THE KINDLE APPPROSLight weightSmall for purseback lightCONS1-comes preloaded with ads2-not easy to get them off if you buy device in a store3-page control is not that simple4-t doesn't auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one OR the other5-not as touch responsive to anything6-don't like the organization of it",TOO MUCH BAGGAGE TO GO THROUGH

2,"I am on my 3rd Kindle. This software downloads new purchases with a picture of the cover of the book on my homepage. Only about a fifth of the available space. So this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small. The new books should be downloaded to my Library in List Form as in the original Kindle. In addition, once you have looked at a book in the homepage, it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category. Finally, this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want. This OS is definitely NOT USER FRIENDLY. It requires a great deal of effort of the user. A lot of wasted data space and waste of time. I am requesting a return to the original Kindle OS.",Original Kindle OS was the best.

2,"Still adjusting...had kindle fire and liked the ease of touch for turning pages, definitions and location in book. Paper weight is Much more difficult to maneuver, doesn't seem to be as touch sensitive as the fire.

2,"The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it.

,"As reviewed by the wife This is the perfect thing for a new mommy who loves to read books!

But how much time do I spend laying in bed, on my side, with the baby while she feeds Especially prior to 4 months when feeding took as long as 45 minutes! Not to mention cluster feeds during growth spurts! A book was out of the question because it's sooo tiring to hold up in side-lying-breastfeeding-position. My new Kindle was the solution! It's light, easy to disinfect (I use baby wipes on the case whenever I feel like it's not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby) and you don't need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing - you know what I mean!And for some reason it's much easier to go through a book with a Kindle compared to an actual book.

2,I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky.

2,"Thought we'd have tons of fun with Alexa; found that had to stretch to use it productively. Maybe that's why Amazon puts out a steady stream of ""Here's what's new with Alexa"" emails, a lot of them revolving around buying more stuff from Amazon.",An answer in search of a question

2,I thought I'd love this but felt like it had very little purpose. Did like it at all.,Not worth the money
2,My wife bought one at Best Buy. I had to go back and get her $40 dollars when the price went from $179 to $139. I decided I would get her one -- but they were out of stock. I ordered one thru Amazon --- but it still hasnt gotten here.,GREAT PRODUCT = IF MINE EVER GETS HERE
2,Bluetooth inaccessible if not connected to Wi-Fi. Device not chargeable hence not portable.,Did NOT meet my expectation!
2,"I bought this to fill my life with music. The first two weeks were fantastic. I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, ""Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)"" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it. After witnessing my problems, people who come over don't want one.",Just ok
2,"continually loses connection to the internet. app says it s connected but says check back later. Worked for the first month or so but now works one minute and dumb two minutes later. Constantly asking Alexa, Alexa,;ALEXA!!",dumb and dumber

2,This device is not as great as advertised. It does not do as many things as expected and you have to go to a lot of trouble to do otherwise,Thought it would be better
2,Thought this would be pretty cool gadget. Not impressed. Poor voice recognition.,Not impressed
2,Not very functional and never had all the answers I needed. And I wanted a device I could make phone calls to anyone with in which the Google home does. We purchased the Google home and we are so glad we did.,Not as smart as Google
2,I don't recommended if you are using Apple products,Hard to understand communication problems
3,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.,A cheap tablet
3,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.",Works well but too tied to Amazon.
3,"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet",Fine for reading

3,"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money.",No Android support
3,"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast.",Decent tablet but not high caliber
3,Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.,Ok for the price
3,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire,frustrating compared to an android

If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.",Great tablet for the price
3,"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one.",Good tablet bad wifi connection
3,"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.",Not an iPad by any means
3,"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied",Not like the older model
3,"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy.",Good tablet for what it does
3,"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful.",Gets the work done

Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market.",Decent for the price
3,It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped,Sad
3,"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product",good
3,"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse.",Better than before
3,Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.,Not for computer beginner
3,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.,stopped working after 3 weeks.
3,ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.,good for price
3,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.,Great tablet for speed
3,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others.",Amazon is amazing

3,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past.",Not ad happy with this one by far
3,"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old.",Very basic
3,Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.,Overall nice display; email setup not so friendly

3,Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.,ok tablet
3,Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.,Found what I needed.
3,Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.,Fire Tablet
3,I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help,Hard to set up
3,"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice.",Kindle Fire HD Just OK
3,"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.",Just ok for the price
3,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.",Still prefer iPad or android tablet
3,Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.,Size and price good.
3,bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.,ok
3,"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.",Nice screen resolution.
3,This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.,"Not bad, just not my flavor of android."
3,Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere,Perfect
3,Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.,Best gift for Beginers
3,works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.,soso
3,Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth.,Not bad
3,my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.,it's ok
3,"The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one .",Not a very good camera .
3,Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started,Not so much
3,"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this.",Fast but screen not as big as ipad mini
3,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could.",Still figuring it out
3,"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this.",It's pretty average for what you are paying
3,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.,Good but...
3,upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.,basic kindle
3,"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it.",Nice Basic tablet
3,I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.,"It's an ok tablet, but very limited in apps."
3,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad.",Burned by fire
3,Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.,It's ok
3,"My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time.",Great xmas gift
3,"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books.",A good improvement over previous models
3,It was great product. the price which I got it was great.,Good product
3,"My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults.",Its an ok tablet.
3,"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive.",A mediocre tablet
3,Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.,Good value for money
3,It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.,Good value tablet
3,"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.",Good buy for the price
3,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.,Great table for children
3,Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.,Great tablet for the price
3,"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...","Good hardware, bad software"
3,This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,Great basic tablet
3,the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.,nice in a price

3,Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks,The camera is awful!
3,"As a low priced 8"" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android.","Usable 8"" tablet, but I wish it were real Android"
3,"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon.","not bad, but..."
3,Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung,It's fair
3,Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.,Good tablet for what it's designed to do
3,It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.,Haven't set it up yet
3,"Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found.",Very limited capabilities.

3,"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50.","Its not an android, but it'll do"
3,"Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games.

3,Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it,Good tablet
3,"The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don't handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great!",Amazon Fire 8 has 90 day warranty

3,Good enough for the price. Great for Amazon subscriptions and Amazon shopping.,Nice tablet.
3,"A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix.

The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price.","More options, more problems"
3,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that.",Okay Tablet
3,The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It's thin and light.,Simple but Good
3,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",Not for me
3,"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.",Wanted to love it
3,"I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",A Step Down In Quality

3,i did not need this,Three Stars

3,"Does what you need, but because it has amazon's name on it, it's expensive",Three Stars
3,"Works as advertised. However, I can't imagine why Amazon doesn't include it with the Kindle. I know of no other product that does not supply an item that is essential to its use. Amazon should include this with the Kindle. So, remember, add the price of one of these to the price of the Kindle to get the real price of the Kindle. That is why I gave it three stars. Come on Amazon, stop the misleading pricing on the Kindle.","Works as advertised. However, I can't imagine why ..."
3,Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.,Good but not great
3,It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!,OK
3,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,Too small
3,In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.,Feels cheap
3,"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it.",Good for beginners
3,There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.,Font size changes with no way to lock it

3,It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.,Can it be used with the library?
3,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.","Amazon Kindle, Black"
3,"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet",too many bells and whistles
3,This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me,No like
3,Buying this device I thought it could replace my phone which my kids love to use to watch their videos. It's great with applications but it's limited when it comes to kids video outside of Amazon's store.,Lack usability
3,"Something new for my wife. She is still earning how to navigate the item but enjoys more apps at her finger tips. Its small and compact and easy t take on trips so she can read, take pictures or listen to her music.",still learning to work this item.

3,"The apps I really want it won't let me download. I don't like that I HAVE to sign up for ""One Click"" with a credit card.",It's okay for my grandson but not so much for me
3,I bought this tablet as Bestbuy was closing them out. I find the screen is okay but not iPad quality. The speed is fine for my intended use but I would not be happy if I needed to use as my primary tablet.The operating system is lower then the current android build and I have not found a upgrade path.,Good value for the price
3,We bought the tablet to give as a prize in a baby shower contest. We thought it was a good price and we decided to purchase.,Baby shower prize

3,the description sounded like the base unit was included with the coding game - which it was not.,online description was misleading
3,This is not recommended if you have inpatient kids.,Slow
3,If you can afford to get the HD versions I would go for those; however this is a great starter kindle. Love all the parent controls!,Good device for price
3,"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services.",Good tablet for the price
3,"I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter, and she can't put it down!",Great tablet for kids!
3,These are perfect for kids to use and have some nice features for only 50 bucks. I recommend.,Decent Cheap Tablet
3,Needs to have some hardcopy instructions in the package..,Almost alli I needed!
3,It's ok. I love that I can set up my 5 year old on his own with the children's setting. The battery dies really fast though. We can't even make it through a long car ride without having to plug it in.,It's ok for the money
3,"The Amazon warranty of this product is great for a reason, it needs to be because they have to keep replacing it. I had two that died within weeks and every single one has broken the screen.","eh, okay starter tablet"
3,"Great tablet for the price! I bought two of these for my Grandkids to use, as they are always using ours! The only thing that I really don't like about them is that they have so many pop in commercials for grown ups and it makes everything stop. Hard for my little three year old to get this! I wish it were a little more kid friendly as far as ease of use and getting to where you want to be. For the price, I guess we will just deal with it! :)",Great tablet for the price

3,works great once I figured it out. Books are easy to download.,works ok
3,Bought this for my daughter. Tablet works amazing. Only thing I didnt like was that you are REQUIRED to place a CC on file with amazon in order to use it.I would say if you are looking for a tablet stick to the samsung galaxy models vs others.,Tablet for my daughter
3,"A decent machine for the Black Friday price of under $40. The 8 GB of memory is inadequate if you play games using the Apps. I added a 32 GB micro SD card, but not all the Apps use it and the ones that do, only transfer part of the application to it. All points, coins, etc earned are retained in internal memory, not SD card. Pictures, videos, music can be stored on SD card. Screen is very sharp.",Slightly Disappointed

3,I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me.

3,Easy to read books. Great for night reading. Easy to download books,Nice tablet
3,"I came across this on sale and couldn't pass it up. Turns out it runs slower than I expected though.

3,"We are pretty unhappy with this purchase. Several of the most popular apps (Instagram, You Tube, etc.) are NOT compatible with this device. Now I know why the sale on this was so great.

3,I purchased this tablet for my sister as a Christmas present.,Christmas Present for my sister

3,"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet.",First Kindle Tablet
3,"I like the Kindle fire over all, but the Kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. We have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. As a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. We still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. Hopefully one day they will design a better charging port",Still not a fan of the charging port

3,Great tablets for everyday use. My child watches his favorite YouTube videos on it.,Great entry level tablet
3,I like the size of it and it's easy to operate. I didn't like that I had to keep trying to put the same information in more than once to more from one screen to another when putting in my card information.

3,"Not sure of quality. His first Kindle Fire would no longer charge properly. It was cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed.

3,"It is too narrow, if watching a vid or utube, some of the pic is cut off. Can't erase the entire history. It keeps it and then recommends still based on your history, even tho you have cleared it. Amazon selling ALL the time is very tiresome. I never go to an ad that follows me from site to site yet it's ubiquitous. Tiresome. Had the fire 8.9 hdx.

3,"I recently purchased this Amazon Fire for my daughter, i like that it has the little accent of a night light, so if we are watching a movie in the dark, she can still use it without illuminating the entire room. features are average, just like any other tablet. It is a little bulky but for a child, it gets the job done. Pretty sturdy when its dropped. Doesnt have much storage, but the good news is you can add your own SD to create more storage.",Good Value
3,"I love this device for my kids who are way too young to trust with a $500 tablet such as an iPad. Works efficiently, my kids love it, & I love the parental control features. If something happens to it, amazon handles it quickly & if it were to break or get lost, it's cheap to replace. That being said, it obviously doesn't hold a candle to Samsung or apple's tablets.

3,Does what you would expect for the price. Not a spectacular device but it gets the job done.,Ok for the price
3,"This Kindle is great for the price. However, there are some downsides to paying for a $50 tablet. The battery life goes very quickly, so daily charges are necessary if you're a heavy reader. You also can't save anything of merit like books or magazines to a mini-SD card, thus making a purchase of one a waste of time and money.","Good eReader, Bad Battery and Horrible Storage"

3,"This is the possibly the best Tablet if you are an Amazon store/prime centric user. But, it doesn't include the Google Play Store and doesn't include most / any of the Google apps, which are stables in the Tablet world. No Google Inbox, etc. For me, this tablet is a ""skip"".

3,"Meets expectations consistent with the price. I don't really use it for anything. It simply can't replace my iPad. Both the screen quality and battery life are poor relative to my iPad 4 from a few years ago, so I haven't found a use for this Kindle Fire. Generally it just feels cheap and the user interface not as clean as the iPad. I think it's value is consistent with the low price point.",Meets price expectations
3,"Works fine for a $50 basic tablet/reader. Other functions, not so great. Very entry level.",Decent for the price
3,"I bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles I purchased. I am disappointed. I like the price. The home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. I mostly use it for reading books, and so far I'm dissatisfied. It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy.",Slow
3,Did what I needed it to do took back to get a bigger size,Cute little tablet
3,"It works great, its just not quite what I wanted for my daughter.","Works like it should, just not what I wanted"
3,"My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me.",Amazon Free Time Ad machine
3,Better quality then most tablets in same price range. I still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it. Ads on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it functions like its supposed to.,Decent Quality
3,"If you don't mind the slow performance, it is a good tablet for the price.",Slow disposable tablet
3,"I would say this is great for kids, but the apps are very limited. There are only a few good free apps in the kindle store. The battery life is very poor. The volume is either loud or it can't be heard. It's hard to find a good middle ground. Overall it's still a good tablet for the price.",Sturdy & durable

4,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account.

4,"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat.",Excellent for it's price point.

4,Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.,Great budget tablet
4,overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice,good value

4,i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.,nice beginner tablet
4,This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.,Perfect for my kids
4,"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library.",Price is great but limited to Amazon Apps

4,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.",Good for what I use it for
4,Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.,Great first tablet
4,Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.,Excellent for the money
4,Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected,Performs as expected

4,I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.,Great for the price
4,Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.,Good for the books.
4,The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!,Easy to Use
4,So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.,Good for the price

4,Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.,Awesome tab for the price.
4,"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card.",I would buy it again

4,I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email,Fun tablet

4,Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading,Cool product

4,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!",Good tablet for reading and watching videos

4,Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.,Good product.
4,Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.,Great for reading
4,Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it,Love this tablet
4,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case.",Not bad for $60 BF Deal
4,"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one.",Kindle 8

4,Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.,Best value for a tablet
4,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.",Christmas gift for my daughter
4,"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.",You get what your paying for
4,"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great.","Works well, but Needs Better Parental Options"
4,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.,Great price point
4,I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price,A very good deal

4,"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials.",Nice for the price !
4,More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful,Nice tool!
4,Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with,Great tablet
4,"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading.",Great Amazon Tablet
4,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.,poor photo quality
4,I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much,Great for beginners
4,Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games.

4,Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend.,Great product
4,The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.,Great Pad but still not the best
4,"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories.","Easy to read, but loses charge fast"
4,It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!,Great for children and learning.
4,good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.,Decent tablet

4,Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader,Great ebook reader
4,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.",One flaw
4,Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.,Good tablet
4,"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets.","Great, but awaiting Alexa feature"
4,"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using.",Great features!
4,This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.,Its a good small tablet
4,"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play.

4,bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime,good
4,Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read,Good Deal
4,"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that.",Great ipad for a beginner such as I am
4,I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.,Excellent tablet for the price
4,Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.,Great basic kindle
4,"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge...",Good IPAD alternative
4,Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder,Better than the Kindle HD 7
4,I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.,Good Value
4,"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc.",Okay tablet
4,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch.",Good for Kids
4,"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better.",Love of games
4,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.",Great Alternative to College Textbooks
4,My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.,I like the Kindle Fire very much.
4,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal.",Solid tablet with potential
4,"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it.",Great Tablet
4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,Great tablet at a great price!
4,"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader.",Good Reader with Internet benefits
4,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.,Great to travel with
4,"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful.",Great tablet
4,its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users,good for its range
4,"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended.",Bang for the buck . . .
4,Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.,Great for hearing impaired in downloading videos
4,I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!,PERFECT!
4,"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight.",Great buy
4,"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too.",Very descent
4,"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased.",Really great for the price!
4,I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?,like product need some help w/questions
4,"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple",Good tablet
4,"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now.",Great For Basic To Moderate Use
4,"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation",Amazon Fire Tablet
4,Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.,Great for my needs...mainly reading and games.
4,I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.,Very Good Tablet for the Money
4,We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.,Decent tablet
4,"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news.",works very well
4,My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.,Great product and cost!
4,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.",Great for the price
4,Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.,Great for my mother in law

4,Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up,Good tablet

4,"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member.",Nice little tablet for the price
4,I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.,Works good. Easy setup.
4,New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.,Love it.
4,Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.,Better than expected

4,It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.,It was a good buy
4,"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.",A Solid Basic Tablet

4,"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle.",Good
4,I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.,Great device
4,I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.,Good for price.
4,Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price,Great tablet for wife.
4,"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.",Kid Friendly
4,"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done.","The Kindle fits me to a ""T""."

4,"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising.",Not bad
4,"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility.",Much better
4,"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful.","Like a laptop, only smaller"

4,"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward.",Great tablet
4,"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.",Great tablet.
4,My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .,Great price
4,I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.,I like

4,"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong.",Pretty good...
4,So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.,Great replacement

4,amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.,great fire
4,"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs",Capable tablet at a bargain price.
4,"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.",Good tablet for the price

4,We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.,It nice
4,"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids",Good value
4,Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.,"Excellent tablet for games, reading, email, photos"
4,I like this and the price is right enjoying it now,great
4,I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well.

4,"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem.",Very easy to use.
4,like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.,like it
4,"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it.",Fire HD tablet
4,"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts.",Was a gift

4,I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!,Surprisingly GOOD
4,Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!,Awesome if you have Amazon Prime
4,"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store.

4,Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.,One of the best fire tablets I've purchased so far
4,"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product.",Great for kids!

4,"These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well.",Kindle Fire HD 8
4,"This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming.

It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline.",So far so good

4,Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.,Great Value after additions
4,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.,Easy to watch videos

4,"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets.",Good for the price

4,"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items.",Mom's Firestick

4,"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!",Second Kindle For My Son
4,Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading,Good
4,"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.",Works for my applications

5,"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there.

5,Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions).

Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets.",Easy to learn to use its many features.
5,"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job.",Great little tablet
5,Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.,Easy to use
5,"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)",Great tablet for kids!
5,"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again.",Love it!
5,"Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well.

5,"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it","Great fun,Educational apps,books,brain teasers"

5,"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself.",Fantastic Tablet for the price

5,"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",Best Decision I Ever Made
